# Page Quest

## Description

This comprehensive application is a testament to the power of full-stack development, incorporating the Google Search API to provide users with an immersive book search experience. Designed as a dedicated space for individuals seeking books by their titles, this app offers robust functionalities, including the ability to query, save, and remove books within a personalized collection.

The driving motivation behind crafting this app was to enhance my proficiency in the intricate interplay between GraphQL, React, and Express, alongside an array of complementary technologies. By seamlessly connecting the frontend and backend aspects, I gained a deeper insight into building a cohesive user experience, all while harnessing the capabilities of modern web development tools. Also creating a way to keep track of books I want to read, and then removing them from my list once finished, gives me a great sense of accomplishment. I'm hoping this will benefit others as much as it has myself.
